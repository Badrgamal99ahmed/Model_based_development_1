I have been learned more about building blocks in Simulink that enable us to create dynamic systems by connecting them in a modle .
each block do a spacific purpose in performing the mathmatical operations 
[constant, display results, gain, sum, product,].
1- product plock  ==> to multiplies two input segnals and produce the product as outpot.
2- constant block ==> to generate constant values.
3- display block  ==> to visualize the value of a signals.
4- Gain block     ==> to multiplies the signals input by constant factor.
5- Sum block      ==> to adds or subtract inputs to gether.
